--Digital Design VHDL Project report

--Introduction

The aim of this project was to create a peak dectector that when fed a series of hexadecimal data values
the peak value was indentied along with the proceeding and previous 3 values. This detector is run on a Xilinx X5 FPGA development
board and communications between the board and desktop computer is handled via the UART RS-232 protocol. Along with the main feature of peak
detection, the system had to respond to certain input commands and produce results as requested. These features are detailed below.

--Group

As group 17 Our four person group consisted of Daryl White, Alexander Hamilton, Sylvia Betrosian and Adreas Michaelides. We met initally
to discuss the project and split up into pairs for work on the Data processor and command processor. Daryl White and Alexander Hamilton
designed and built the Data Processor and Sylvia Betrosian and Adreas Michaelides designed and built the Command Procssor.


--Plan

A large part of this assignment was learning to break down large portions of the project into smaller tasks that could be allocated to each
group memember and the experience of coordinating work efforts so that each component integrated correctly once the final system was built.

Our group decided to meet every two weeks to discuss progress and problems and, before the interim deadline, test the interaction of the
data processor and command processor.

Within each two person team a gnatt chart was drawn up to plan when each segment of the respective processor should be completed by.

Gnatt Chart and key milestone dates.

The key milestones for this project were the interim assignment deadline on Friday 24th March and the final synthesised deadline on 28th April and the presentation date of
